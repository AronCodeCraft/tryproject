    Aaron Fotheringham is an extreme wheelchair athlete who performs tricks adapted from skateboarding and BMX. He competes in the Vegas Am Jam series in skate park competitions, usually against BMX riders.

    Fotheringham calls his activity "WCMX". He is the first person to successfully perform a backflip[1] in a wheelchair at the age of 14, and a double backflip[2] at the age of 18. He performs many other tricks in his wheelchair including 180 degree 'aerials', one-wheeled spins and rail grinds.[3] He plans to fuse the back flip with the 180 aerial into what is known as a 'flair'.
